1.  pyramid scene. for everything have a default value. The specific pages specifies, otherwilse default value
1. design the user journey to do 1 thing at each step
2. the input table and the output table are always different tables
3. the blog should let noobs be able to find and use excel functions.
4. but the naming conventions is still used by programming languages
5. all data are stored in python dict, not in js
6. try to avoid nested dicts
7. Maybe a good design would be to let user choose no option?
=split join into left join, right join, etc. no option needed
8. content drives template design. if text exists, then create template.
