This is a mindnote for designing blogs and tools

general
1. make website same color, do not use outstanding color = room full of shouting people



tool
1. design the user journey to do 1 thing at each step
2. the input table and the output table are always different tables
3. the blog should let noobs be able to find and use excel functions.
4. but the naming conventions is still used by programming languages
