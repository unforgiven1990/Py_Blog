                <p class="mb-5 ">this is a mocup summary</p>
                <p>The author of this article shares his thoughts on B-side product planning. The author of this article shares his thoughts on B-side product planning, take a look.</p><p>The author reviews nearly three years of product road, product planning ideas about B-end products, for this reason, I want to share with you product fellow travelers to exchange.</p><p>First, the overall idea</p><p>The overall planning of large B-end products is characterized by an increasingly wide range of business support, business trends are increasingly intelligent and efficient, are the core of the enterprise's own business lateral and vertical development, the general idea is as follows.</p><p>Horizontal planning ideas: internal processes/modules of key systems → internal processes or similar modules of secondary systems → integration of internal resources of enterprises → integration of internal and external resources of enterprises</p><p>Vertical planning ideas: support the basic business → planning business → forecast guidance business → automation business (not necessarily have this stage)</p><p>In practice the horizontal and vertical development ideas are combined, not necessarily planned in order, the actual development path to the enterprise's own circumstances prevail.</p><p>Second, the planning method</p><p>The overall planning of B-end products is not empty, B-end products are for the enterprise business services, so its planning itself must be carried out at the root of the enterprise business, in terms of the author's own work experience, there are two models of top-to-bottom planning and bottom-to-top planning.</p><p>The actual initiator of top-down products is the top of the enterprise, while bottom-up is generally the planning characteristics of the product proposed by the business sector, but they can basically follow the following way to carry out product planning.</p><p>Starting from business needs</p><p>Combined with the strategic development direction of the enterprise or project positioning</p><p>Digging into business trends</p><p>The actual initiator of the top-down product is the top management of the enterprise, while the bottom-up is generally the planning characteristics of the product proposed by the business department.</p><p>1. Starting from business requirements</p><p>According to the business sector and the actual use of the user object to start, find the core business processes, lock the main user role, organize the business documents involved, the key is to sort out the business priorities.</p><p>In terms of the author's actual work, the business sector is generally the initiative to find the production and research team to put forward the actual business needs at this stage, in this case it is very easy to collect the business needs and sort out the overall business process. The following situations need to be considered by product managers.</p><p>Distinguish whether the business process is fixed, whether it is the business department's own business, or whether it belongs to a short period of time due to unclear division of labor, the business department is strong, resulting in the business is responsible for this department.</p><p>Whether there are other departments in the enterprise that have similar business needs to the business unit</p><p>The relationship between the business and other businesses, whether it involves other business systems in the enterprise</p><p>The first point is actually the project risk, if the risk is greater in fact, the core of the problem is the business department business overreach, and not the real business later responsible for the department, so it is recommended not to do this business. If there is really no way to need to do without talking about product planning, as simple as possible to meet the requirements of the existing business.</p><p>The second point of concern is the commonality and characteristics of the business, if the enterprise has similar business needs within the department, integrated together to conduct demand research to see if they can provide business support together; if it happens that their business objectives and processes have a high degree of commonality, such as the operations team responsible for various corporate sub-brands, joint consideration of the overall demand, the architecture of a large enterprise back office; if it is said that although the same business in general but If the characteristics are largely the same business but with big differences, such as online mall sales and offline store retail, then do not force it, just consider it separately.</p><p>The third point to consider is the relationship between business-based systems and surrounding systems, and there are two planning ideas.</p><p>Complete the internal business independently first before considering interfacing with other business systems</p><p>Develop the interface with other business systems from the beginning and then gradually deepen the internal business</p><p>If the business system to be docked is a relatively stable, multi-functional interface business system, consider docking in advance; if the business system to be docked is an easy to change, the need for cross-departmental docking, in the author's practical experience, generally choose to complete the internal business first independently, while developing Good basic data format to facilitate subsequent docking. 2.</p><p>2. Combined with the strategic development direction of the enterprise or project positioning</p><p>If you can combine the enterprise strategy, generally this B-end product will be built from the top of the enterprise, it will be one of the support systems or systems for the top strategy of the enterprise, which is a top-to-bottom guidance, and will have a relatively clear project or product positioning.</p><p>At this time, according to the corporate strategy, split the milestones, combined with the milestones to develop product strategy. The basic idea is to split the goal into executable business and modules, first core and then auxiliary, first support the current stage and then business optimization, planning the overall business and module design route, and then from bottom to top from business needs, user needs, for detailed business design.</p><p>3. mining business trends</p><p>The key to business trends is to grasp the direction of business development, you can refer to the market products, but the focus is still on the business itself. In the author's actual experience, the following methods are summarized.</p><p>1) Point-line construction</p><p>Many times the business needs put forward by business people, in fact, is only a point on the business line he is responsible for, and the product needs to dig the overall business line, and ultimately cover the business sector or business direction.</p><p>2）Similar functional extensions</p><p>For the marketing platform this type of system, there will be a variety of internal tools with the same general goal, to enrich the means to achieve the goal, which can be used as a reference for pre-product planning.</p><p>3) Data strategy trends</p><p>When the product is implemented for a period of time, will get more data, to plan how to use these data, can be used as a product planning for the medium and long term.</p><p>The author provides some ideas here: data can be used for data analysis, data forecasting, risk prevention, but also combined with the strategy for business automation. Data forecasting can provide guidance on costs, benefits, and risks to help managers make relevant decisions.</p><p>Strategy-driven, on the other hand, can reduce manpower and improve efficiency in specific business execution, and reasonable strategies can amplify benefits.</p><p>(4) Combination of internal and external resources of the enterprise</p><p>First of all, it should be clear that different systems have different degrees of contact with external resources of the enterprise, and different degrees of demand for external resources management of the enterprise, so it is not always necessary to consider external resources of the enterprise.</p><p>Secondly, if you need to consider the external resources of the enterprise, its planning route is mainly to first consider what the main external resources of the business, such as domestic enterprises doing CRM systems, when to do SCRM, the priority is the same as the WeChat ecology, are adhering to the first to grasp the main after the core.</p><p>Third, planning hands-on</p><p>1. to enterprise strategy as the core: from top to bottom of the product planning</p><p>I am responsible for the new retail system of my company, which is one of the main support systems of the enterprise's strategic plan for the next three years.</p><p>Our enterprise marketing digital reform is divided into three steps: digitalization of main business → digitalization of enterprise marketing, building an integrated brand marketing center → sales-driven supply chain reform.</p><p>The responsibility of the new retail system in the enterprise strategy is to realize the digitalization of the enterprise offline sales channels, because our offline sales cooperation mode only adopts the direct mode, so the main targets of the overall platform of the new retail system are offline sales companies, distributors, stores and headquarters, without considering the case of interfacing with other external offline sales systems.</p><p>Under the strategic plan of the enterprise for the next three years, after clarifying the user objects, the first user objects and business were researched, knowing that the main business of offline channels at this stage are</p><p>Sales</p><p>Inventory</p><p>Finance</p><p>After-sales</p><p>Among them, sales, inventory, and finance (the finance module was set up as a separate project team and was not included in the new retail system) did not have related systems, while after-sales had a mature system. Combined with the company's strategic plan, the following product release plan was developed.</p><p>New Retail V1.0 to realize business informationization for dealers, stores and sales companies</p><p>New Retail V2.0 builds the offline channel operation center and transforms the store's human and goods field</p><p>New Retail V3.0 combines the end of sales with the corporate brand supply chain, transforming the corporate supply chain</p><p>These three versions are planned based on the corporate strategy, and then adjusted based on the actual business situation. Then, according to the planning of the big version and then continue to split, take New Retail V1.0 as an example, its product planning is as follows.</p><p>New Retail V1.0 Sales business informatization: complete offline business minimal mvp: build retail workbench, complete offline transaction management, order management, commodity management, return management module</p><p>New Retail V1.1 Warehouse business informatization: build the inventory system, complete inventory management, warehouse management, and outbound inventory management modules; add inventory inquiry to the retail workbench</p><p>New Retail V1.2 Basic Organizational Business Management: Build terminal management backend, complete organization management, authority management, position management and personnel management; add personnel management and account management to Retail Workbench; add personnel management to the inventory system</p><p>New Retail V1.3 Improve management background: Terminal management background adds order management, basic information maintenance, inventory management, sales performance management (including sales task setting) customer management; Retail Workbench adds customer management, sales performance management (including sales task setting)</p><p>The main idea is to move from business to module, from core to secondary, from satisfying the basic business to higher level planning business, for example, the sales task setting in New Retail V1.3 actually reflects the planning of sales business. If the system can follow up with sales performance suggestions based on sales ability, historical data and market conditions, then it will reach the stage of forecasting and guiding business. 2.</p><p>2. Business needs as the core: bottom-up product planning</p><p>I have been in charge of the brand marketing center of my company, and this project is a typical bottom-up product planning model.</p><p>At the beginning, we first received very specific business needs from various business departments, such as sending SMS, receiving red packets, sending questionnaires ...... at that time was to do the system one by one according to the needs of business departments, and subsequently found that these departments looking for our section were mainly marketing-related business departments, so we proposed that it would be better to build a unified marketing center platform, which is used to meet most of the marketing tasks.</p><p>In this way, the relevant business departments were researched, and the business needs they used to present to our section were actually just a part of their real business, just the way of marketing. We then sorted out their business and researched and referred to relevant platforms in the market, and then developed the following product plan.</p><p>User digital operation platform V1.0: Enriching operation means</p><p>User Digital Operation Platform V2.0: Data-driven Operation</p><p>In the first big version, it mainly went to dig more operation tools and build the basic platform management module. The product planning of the small version at that time was the planned development order of each product tool and the order of reconstructing the previous product tools, plus.</p><p>And in the second major version, 4 major modules were planned.</p><p>Operation module</p><p>User data module</p><p>Market Quotation Module</p><p>System management module</p><p>The modules in the first major version, and then in the second major version are divided into the operations module and system management module, the author was mainly responsible for the operations module, its planning ideas are</p><p>Continue to enrich the operation tools</p><p>Management of operational activities from the perspective of operational tasks</p><p>Consider from the overall business line, from planning → implementation → collection → analysis → guidance planning</p><p>Pay attention to the flow of data</p><p>Finally, no matter which way, B-side products must adhere to the core of the actual business of the enterprise to carry out the overall product planning.</p><p>Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)</p>
