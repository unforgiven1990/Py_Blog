                <p>Editor's Note: What are tags? Tags can help us identify or define certain types of content, however, as our business scenarios become more and more complex, &quot;tags&quot; also need to be &quot;iterated&quot; in order to adapt to more diverse practical scenarios. Let's take a look at the author's summary based on actual business problems.</p><p>As the business of the management platform becomes more and more complex, the scope of the scenario continues to expand, the details of the design will also continue to enlarge, adapt to the needs of the application to the scenario, from a single attribute to the batch. Going to the batch that will inevitably expose some problems.</p><p>The purpose of this article is to illustrate the multiple scenarios under the complex business, even a label, will be magnified to see. And no longer on the design details of the specific design show, aims to provide a way.</p><p>This is organized because of the discussion with the product, the product said it encountered a problem about the business complexity after the label management problem.</p><p>Baidu's definition of &quot;label&quot; is used to mark the product objectives and categories or content, easy to find and locate the target tools, and other more detailed expression. In my personal view at work, tagging is the classification of data information mark, will also come with some functions, such as the deletion of tags.</p><h2>I. Several phenomena were found in the project</h2><p>results in data tables with multiple different data field types label distinction is not obvious.</p><p>Tag style can not meet the needs of more complex scenarios after the update.</p><p>Problem</p><p>The label needs to produce a label style that distinguishes between different scenarios, as well as multiple types of labels at the same time.</p><p>Simply put, the visual style of labels in multiple scenes is defined to avoid the problem of visual interference in cross scenes.</p><p>In order to distinguish the labels applied in different scenes, the labels also need to be classified and designed, while different labels will also cross in a certain to scenes, when the labels need to be designed differently.</p><h2>Second, several scenarios of label application</h2><p>Labels commonly used in tables and lists.</p><p>Classification and data segmentation filtering within query modules.</p><p>multiple tags within data fields.</p><p>Precise ideographic data within the data, icons instead of field labels.</p><h2>III. Types of tagging scenarios</h2><p>1. Status tags: tables, lists</p><p>The most common types of tags used in the management system.</p><h3>1) List status tags</h3><p>Generally expressed as a marker of the current data-related business flow to a stage.</p><p>B-side design｜Tag management</p><h3>2）Card Status Label</h3><p>The visual presentation is different from the list status, but the meaning expressed is the same. The layout is adjusted according to the data content and functional requirements.</p><p>B-side design｜Tag management</p><p>(Content after word processing)</p><p>2. Select tabs: query module, segmentation filtering</p><p>Commonly used in the query screening function area, the data needed to query from the big data, the need for fine screening, fine screening one kind of search, another is the keyword screening, the same kind of e-commerce platform.</p><p>B-side design｜Tag management</p><p>3. Category header tagging labels: data results (paragraph type, template type)</p><p>Data content requirements, can not be displayed like a list, so the paragraph-style presentation, marker tags placed at the beginning of the paragraph.</p><p>B-side design｜Tag management</p><p>B-side design｜Tag management</p><p>4. Data tags: Data categorization</p><p>This kind of tag appears relatively few, with the operation function. Take the following figure as an example, it is simply to categorize the term class under a certain entity.</p><p>B-side design｜Tag management</p><p>5. Field tagging tags: Multiple segment data information tagging and prioritization</p><p>The content of tag marking within a data field exists. The maximum length of such field has an upper limit, so it is allowed to be displayed within the field.</p><p>B-side design｜Tag management</p><p>As shown below, multiple tags are cross-displayed, and field tags better display the keywords of the data. Different field tagging styles are also layered to prioritize data display.</p><p>B-side design｜Tag management</p><p>6. Icon tagging: Iconic ideograms, graphical and fast-perceivable tags</p><p>Icons instead of text, one is visually easier to identify the distinction, ideographic accurate and direct; in the use of space, reduce space occupation.</p><p>B-side design｜Label management</p><p>In the above diagram, the ring diagram is more accurate and intuitive to express the proportion of men and women; in the lower diagram, &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; are replaced by icons and distinguished by color, which is more prominent.</p><p>B-side design｜Tag management</p><h2>7. Multiple labels mixed</h2><p>Icons and status mixed labels appear in the same data scene.</p><p>B-side design｜Label management</p><p>Lastly, don't take the smallest thing for granted, but the smallest details can affect the use.</p>
