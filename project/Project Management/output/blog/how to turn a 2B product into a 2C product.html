                <p class="mb-5 ">this is a mocup summary</p>
                <p>Editor's Note: The C-side industry is already a red sea, and the traffic dividend has almost peaked, so many companies have turned their attention to the B-side industry. Although the future of B-side products is promising, but the first contact with the B-side product managers are still confused, more wait-and-see people are slow to make up their minds. As a product designer, there is a lot of potential for B-side product design. The author of this article has expressed his own views on this, to share with you.</p><p>Recently, many friends have added me to WeChat to &quot;consult&quot; me about one or two things (consulting is really not a good idea, at best, we are discussing together), basically focusing on B-side product design, and with a little organization, probably the following issues appear more frequently.</p><p>The first two questions can be known by Baidu, I will not say more, focus on the last one: B-side today there are still any opportunities for designers to play the space?</p><p>When I was thinking about this issue and no results, I stumbled upon today's headlines online &quot;me and my hometown&quot;, you can watch it for free, I used the time to sit on the toilet to watch it off and on. It is also interesting to say that I feel that I have found the answer to this movie: melodramatic movies are inevitable if they want to be accepted by the public.</p><p>From the year the fire to the &quot;founding of the country&quot; to last year's &quot;I and my hometown&quot; are typical melodramatic films entertainment; this thing let me understand, glorifying the motherland may not be to tear the ghosts, Master Ge You and Uncle Shen Teng's paragraph can also let me understand things. So don't just stick to it, break the game or follow the trend may be the way of the future.</p><p>I used this idea set just under the problem, well ~ perhaps B-end C is the new direction of the future toB products;.</p><p>01</p><p>In terms of design style, the trend of B-end products taking the old road of C-end has become more and more obvious; from my point of view, the reason is mainly (all speculation), the identity is blurred (switching back and forth between citizens and employees) but the bearer equipment remains unchanged (all cell phones or computers), the APP opened in line with the trend of more and more convergence, based on the scene to change the demand for a significant reduction.</p><p>Focus back again, the C-side products from the beginning of the advocacy of &quot;fancy&quot; to the present &quot;senior sense&quot; evolution process has gone a long way, then the B-side also followed from &quot;restraint / simplicity&quot; The B-side also evolved from &quot;restraint / simplicity&quot; to &quot;seniority&quot;, which is reflected in 2 points: information level and color system. 1.</p><p>1. Information level: high encapsulation, low density</p><p>I don't know if you have noticed, in the past experience of using To B, there will be a special tired feeling? I have always insisted on a point of view, whether it is UI or interaction to do the essence of the design is also the rearrangement and processing of information; through the design of the comfortable is the king.</p><p>The core point of C is the processing of information, the previous To B products of high information density and modularity encapsulation of low quality, with the arrival of the new direction is bound to exit the stage of history; (PS. These phrases are knowledge points ha, hurry to write down, save the time of reporting only know how to say the big words, do not know how to support with theory).</p><p>In addition, with the MacOS and windows design language upgrade (in a sense the operating system is also a B-end tool), more and more products follow the line of &quot;material differentiation layer&quot;, which is also a good practice, Ali cloud is a typical: 2.</p><p>2. color system</p><p>If you are my old readers, you should remember that I wrote an article related to color, which has a relatively comprehensive definition of the theory and practice of color system, if you are interested, you can look through, in addition to prepare a color sample, you need to try the iron (there is a way to receive the end of the article).</p><p>Here again, as the B-side, a little red among all the green is the best way to form a &quot;sense of seniority&quot;, the other will not start.</p><p>Before the rumor that the B-side does not need visual design? I really do not agree with ah, does not look good is also a bad experience, after all, the value is justice, good-looking is not shameful, not in the look is taboo, do not give the B-end product blind definition, do a good-looking and useful products ta not smell it.</p><p>02</p><p>From my perception, user experience is no longer distinguished from B/C end for many years, but the experience of B-end products is far less than that of C-end products so far; the reasons for this are just these 2 points.</p><p>The reason for this is that the user is basically given the name of &quot;professional&quot;, so there are many design concepts of &quot;I thought you knew&quot;; as for the huge amount of information or not, frankly speaking, the reason for this is most likely that the processing of information in the interaction is not in place, and the multiple reuse of a single process is repeated over and over again, resulting in the illusion of looking huge.</p><p>1. &quot;Single-threaded&quot; becomes &quot;multi-threaded&quot;</p><p>The main theme of B-end products is always &quot;efficiency&quot;, simplifying complex processes and focusing on current tasks is the &quot;standard method&quot; of experience; I never deny the pursuit of efficiency, but I'm still skeptical about the implementation of the method. The red dot on the tab is dragged to eliminate all information.</p><p>As shown above, this interaction design solves the problem of integrating single-threaded operations into a single act of control of multi-threaded operations, reducing the waste of a lot of labor repetition; it's not easy to understand when you put it this way, but it's better to use a diagram to show that.</p><p>Similar products and 12306 ticketing, the idea is also roughly the same, if you are going home for the New Year need to buy tickets, when you calculate the number of cars and time, is not allowed to grab tickets line by line? The ticket is to help you plan the line, you only need to set the end point, ta automatically triage to, match to the right car, this is a single operation into a multi-threaded processing approach;.</p><p>In fact, many work scenarios abound with the need for multi-threaded automation. For example, when uploading files within many enterprises, uploading a file and waiting for a while, not to mention how inefficient it is, but more importantly, the rhythm of work is destroyed.</p><p>To summarize, in some scenarios (probably most) there is no need to focus on the process, it may be more meaningful to focus on the results.</p><p>Although the workers are invincible, but they can't carry everything, set the starting point and the end point of the work, and allocate energy is also the responsibility of B-side product design, other irrelevant process, as long as there are no major mistakes, let it go ~.</p><p>2. newbie guidance and user feedback to do smart</p><p>Whether it is B or C in the mainstream of newbie guidance method, basically is up a brain / pour all of its show me all the features, each time is helpless to wildly click the next step next. But when I used it for a while, I found that I didn't recognize all the features, I could never get back to the newbie guide. Ha, can not reproduce, this nerve should be the worst experience! Based on this, I suggest that the newbie guide should be combined with the content scenario, so as to achieve the purpose of learning the operation by means of scenario traction.</p><p>To give an example of user ratings.</p><p>In short, reducing user trial and error will certainly optimize user experience greatly.</p><p>03</p><p>Special circumstances affect make this year a year of high speed development of enterprise products, and all kinds of enterprise track horns have been blown. The era of spelling function has passed, and experience is likely to be the key point to decide the purchase decision. Therefore, it is the biggest contribution to business to find the experience breakthrough without changing the function and underlying technology. In addition, I hope you won't be too obsessed with the so-called industry standard methods, try to break the barriers and stand on the perspective of &quot;product experience architect&quot; to see the mountains.</p>
